    <h1>An introduction to reverse mathematics</h1>
    
    <p class="date">March  2, 2012 | Benedict Eastaugh</p>
    
    <p>In December 2011 I gave a presentation on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics">reverse mathematics</a> to the local logic seminar. Having neglected this site for so long, it seemed like a good idea to publish <a href="../files/rm-handout-2011.pdf">my handout</a> from the presentation here. Here’s a teaser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In ordinary mathematical practice, mathematicians prove theorems, reasoning from a fixed set of axioms to a logically derivable conclusion. The axioms in play are usually implicit: mathematicians are not generally in the habit of asserting at the beginning of their papers that they assume ZFC. Given a particular proof, we might reasonably ask which axioms were employed, making explicit the author’s assumptions.</p>
<p>Now that we have a set of axioms <span class="math inline"><em>Γ</em></span> which are sufficient to prove some theorem <span class="math inline"><em>φ</em></span>, we could further inquire whether or not they are <em>necessary</em> to prove the theorem, or whether a strictly weaker set of axioms would suffice. To a first approximation, reverse mathematics is the programme of discovering precisely which axioms are both necessary and sufficient to prove any given theorem of ordinary mathematics.</p>
<p>Expanding on this slightly, in reverse mathematics we calibrate the proof-theoretic strength of theorems of ordinary mathematics by proving equivalences between those theorems and systems of axioms in a hierarchy of known strength. This characterisation should provoke at least three immediate questions. Which hierarchy of systems? How do these equivalence proofs work? And just what is “ordinary mathematics”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the answers to these questions, and many more, you can read my <a href="../files/rm-handout-2011.pdf">introduction to reverse mathematics</a>. If you notice any mistakes, please drop me a line via <a href="mailto:benedict@eastaugh.net">email</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/extralogical">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>A note for the eagle-eyed: at one point I claim that an equivalence between <span class="math inline">ACA<sub>0</sub></span> and some statement <span class="math inline"><em>φ</em></span> would have to involve a theorem scheme, and thus cannot be formalised at the level of the object language. However, the latter does not strictly follow from the former, as <span class="math inline">ACA<sub>0</sub></span> is finitely axiomatisable. For more details on this, read Peter Smith’s <a href="http://www.logicmatters.net/2007/09/aca0-3-finite-axiomatizability/">handy little guide</a> to finitely axiomatising <span class="math inline">ACA<sub>0</sub></span>.</p>
